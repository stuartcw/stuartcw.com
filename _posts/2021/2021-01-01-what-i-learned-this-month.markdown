# What I learned in January 2021


### Etymology

**Destiny vs Fate vs Weird**

Someone asked what is the difference between fate and destiny. As I have mentioned before, similar words in English often came into the language and different times from different languages as I will explain:

**Destiny**

This is the easiest word to trace it's from the Latin word destinare "make firm, establish" (like destination). i.e. "that which has been firmly established," as by fate and is usually a positive meaning.

**Fate**

The word ‚Äúfate‚Äù and also the word ‚Äúweird‚Äù is related to the idea of "The Fates" being, usually three, female beings who rule the destiny of gods and men. They appear in many European mythologies. Also know as Norns in Norse mythology, in Greek Moirai and the Roman Parcae. They were often depicted as weavers of a tapestry on a loom, with the thread dictating the destiny each person. Once the cloth of your life is woven then there is no way to change it. It is your fate.
Fate is from the Latin word "fatum" a "prophetic declaration of what must be, oracle, prediction," thus the Latin word's usual sense is "that which is ordained, destiny, fate," literally "a thing spoken by the gods," originally from the past participle of fari "to speak". It's often used in a bad or negative sense: I.e. "bad luck, ill fortune; mishap, ruin; a pest or plague."

**Weird**

The original word in English for ‚Äúfate‚Äù was ‚Äúwyrd‚Äù as in Shakespeare's weird sisters, the three fates or Norns (in Germanic mythology), the goddesses who controlled human destiny. In the theatre they were portrayed as odd or frightening in appearance, as in Shakespeare"s play "Macbeth" and especially in 18th and 19th century productions of it, which led to the adjectival meaning "odd-looking, uncanny" (in 1815); "odd, strange, disturbingly different" (in 1820).
The world "wyrd" comes from the Proto-Germanic ‚Äúwurdiz‚Äù, from the Proto-Indo-European ‚Äúwert-‚Äú (‚Äúto turn, wind‚Äù) which is the origin of the name of the Norns, ur√∞r. This is related also to the turning of the spinning wheel that the Fates use to spin the thread of your life.

**Fatal**

Finally, another related word is ‚Äúfatal‚Äù. We use it to describe something like an injury or illness that brings death but the original meaning is that this was the fate that brought you to your death. Thus a fatal injury.

## Projects

### Radiation Counter

* Radiation Counter attached to my Raspberry Pi. I found the serial port Geiger Counter that bought in 2011 and resurrected it. I also found a Linux Python script for it which I hacked a bit to be able to save the readings in JSON files. I'm planning on reading this with another program and feeding them into a RRD file and from that making graphs which I post can post to Twitter. After that I think I'll download the tweet archive for the radiation counter account that I made and see if I can put all the historical figure into RRD.

```
tldr jq     

  A command-line JSON processor that uses a domain-specific language.
  More information: <https://stedolan.github.io/jq>.

  Output a JSON file, in pretty-print format:

      jq . file.json

  Output all elements from arrays (or all the values from objects) in a JSON file:

      jq '.[]' file.json

  Read JSON objects from a file into an array, and output it (inverse of `jq .[]`):

      jq --slurp . file.json

  Output the first element in a JSON file:

      jq '.[0]' file.json

  Output the value of a given key of the first element in a JSON text from `stdin`:

      cat file.json | jq '.[0].key_name'

  Output the value of a given key of each element in a JSON text from `stdin`:

      cat file.json | jq 'map(.key_name)'

  Output the value of multiple keys as a new JSON object (assuming the input JSON has the keys `key_name` and `other_key_name`):

      cat file.json | jq '{my_new_key: .key_name, my_other_key: .other_key_name}'

  Combine multiple filters:

      cat file.json | jq 'unique | sort | reverse'

  Output the value of a given key to a string (and disable JSON output):

      cat file.json | jq --raw-output '"some text: \(.key_name)"'
