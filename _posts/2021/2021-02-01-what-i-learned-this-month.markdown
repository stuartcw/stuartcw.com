# What I learned in February 2021

## xonsh

Xonsh is a Python-powered, cross-platform, Unix-gazing shell language and command prompt. The language is a superset of Python 3.5+ with additional shell primitives that you are used to from Bash and IPython. It works on all major systems including Linux, Mac OSX, and Windows. Xonsh is meant for the daily use of experts and novices alike.


## Mermaid Diagrams

"Diagramming and documentation costs precious developer time and gets outdated quickly. But not having diagrams or docs ruins productivity and hurts organizational learning.

Mermaid addresses this Catch-22 by cutting the time, effort and tooling that is required to create modifiable diagrams and charts, for smarter and more reusable content. Mermaid, as a text-based diagramming tool allows for quick and easy updates, it can also be made part of production scripts (and other pieces of code), to make documentation much easier. With Mermaid less time needs to be spent on making diagrams, as a separate documentation task."
