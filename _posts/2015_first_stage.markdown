## 1st Stage Result - 6th place:

Not bad. Given at the start of the season we were worried that we were without any new players and especially without a striker the rise up the table to top third is about as good as we can expect. We were expecting a bottom third placement at the start of the year.

## 1st stage high point:

Our winning matches. Most of these were a relief rather than a glorious victory over a worthy opponent.

## 1st stage low point:

* 3-1 Home loss against Kawasaki. I thought we were done for.
* 1-0 Away loss to Yamagata. Very disappointing.
* 3-0 Home loss against Kashima. Totally outclassed.
* The whole of the Nabsico cup except the last match against Yamagata where the 3rd team took them on and won.
* Announcement that Tomizawa was leaving.

## Playing style/set-up/

We are playing a more open attacking formation this year. Definitely new ideas have been put in place. Unfortunately there seems to be more goals conceded and more subsequent collapse after graduating from slow total possession play.

## Best Player:

Most improved player is Mikado who was a forgotten about in the previous season and then became a surprise regular member well liked by the fans.

Kida has now become a regular which is good for his exposure. I hope we don't loose him to a club willing to give him a substantial pay rise.

## Mombaerts:

Arriving late in the closed season in time for the training camp, Eric Mombaerts was immediately liked by the players. He increased the fitness of the team with a more interesting European training regime though I wonder how many injuries were caused due to the harder regime as many players were taken out of action at the start of the year.

Fans who returned mid stage to see the team commented that even though many of the members were the same, the team was playing in a totally different way. His impact on the team is easy to see.

If Mombaerts is allowed to restructure the team at the end of the year bigger and more visible changes will be evident. I expect some of the starting members who have been relegated to squad members this year to leave after not getting so much top team action.
 Hopefully this will coincide with the players that we want to leave.
 
Nice guy if you meet him in person. 
 
## Ademilson:

Ademilson has been a good addition to the team. He provides entertaining and unexpected play and has set up quite a few attacks with skilful and unpredictable play that is unlike other players definitely add spice to the match. Unfortunately he has not been able to become the goal machine that we hoped, hopefully this will change in the second stage. In person he is really nice guy and looks like he is enjoying himself in Japan.

- What to expect in the 2nd stage:

Possibly due to Kurihara's injury in the first stage, the back three defence has looked less solid than before and Kurihara returns to fitness we may see less goals conceded.

Really nice guy if you meet him in person. Very good with kids and supporters.

## Any others?

Shunsuke mentioned the other day that the team seem to have come together without him. Could this be his last season?
