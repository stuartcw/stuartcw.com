# What I learned in March 2020

## Another Meta Learning Experience

* https GitHub pages. I updated the DNS and tinkered around with the Github settings to enable https. I'm still not sure about what exactly multiple A records achieve but it seems to be working now.. at least on Safari.

## Python

### Arrow: Better dates & times for Python

[Arrow](https://arrow.readthedocs.io)

> Arrow is a Python library that offers a sensible and human-friendly approach to creating, manipulating, formatting and converting dates, times and timestamps. It implements and updates the datetime type, plugging gaps in functionality and providing an intelligent module API that supports many common creation scenarios. Simply put, it helps you work with dates and times with fewer imports and a lot less code.

## Python Anywhere
